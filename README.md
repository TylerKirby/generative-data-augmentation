# Generative Algorithms for Data Augmentation
## Set Up Instructions
1. After cloning the project, create a folder in this directory called `data`. 
2. Download the Fruit 360 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits), unzip the files, and place them under the `data` directory.
3. Install the required packages via pip (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). It is reccomended that you create a virtual environment for this project.
4. Run `generate_dataset.py` to create a sampled dataset to work from.
